# Airline-Database
Airline model demonstrating use of SQL

Airline-Database is a model of an airline's mySQL database.  The two SQL files in the main directory are used to create and populate a database, described by the database schema.  

The folder labled Airline_Database can be used to implement the front end program that can be used to access the database.  The front end program is written in Java using Netbeans and contains several forms allowing the creation and deletion of different indexes, as well as handling the transaction processing and connecting.
